Sure, blogging may sound like an old-fashioned way to socialize in the 2010s but it definitely helps in building an online presence. In a nutshell, online presence is the rank of your profile on Google when searched for your name. Yes, the position at which a result is shown is<!-- more --> known as the rank of a page. Google's algorithms ranks each page to show results in increasing order of relevance (Fact: Google's _"I'm Feeling Lucky"_ button takes you directly to the first page). Creating an online presence becomes even more challenging when you share your name with hundreds of people. Yes, I am talking about the exact same combination of the first name and the last name. To get a sense of measure, it may interest you to know that I have had my namesakes both in school and college. So it may take striving efforts for me to build up my rank and perhaps even more to maintain it.

Blogging is similar to writing diary except, people don't go too deep about sharing details about their personal lives. There is a constant flux of exciting and random thoughts crossing my mind every day. And so I've decided to log each one of them, and the best ones will find their place over here. I will be talking about the way I feel about the world, occasionally about the things happening in my life, and besides that, about the stuff I do. I would like to call this blog as my _open-diary_. Everyone is welcome to delve into it.

Blogging is also a way of staying connected to a language. Since English is not native to India, I don’t get enough opportunity to converse in it on a day-to-day basis. This blog will act as an outlet where I will try to articulate myself in the English language. As a suggestion, I would recommend start writing a blog or a diary to anyone who wishes to become proficient in their second language.

I would appreciate if readers could drop their suggestions or even better, proofread my posts. I am also using some online tools to rectify the most critical mistakes, but for those ‘advanced’ errors, your input would prove to be a great help.
